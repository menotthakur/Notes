End-to-End Cloud Resource Monitoring Automation
This project automates the process of listing active AWS resources (such as EC2, S3) using a shell script to help DevOps teams monitor resource usage and optimize costs.

Overview
Objective
Automate the process of listing active AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3) using a shell script.

Why
DevOps Engineers need such scripts to monitor resource usage for cost optimization.
Helps in day-to-day operations and automation workflows like cron jobs.
Key Concepts
Purpose of Shell Scripting in DevOps:
Automates repetitive tasks.
Ensures consistency in operations like listing, monitoring, or resource management.
What the Script Does:
Connects to AWS.
Lists active resources for specified services (e.g., EC2, S3).
Takes two inputs: region and service.
Inputs and Outputs:
Inputs: AWS region and service name (e.g., us-east-1, ec2).
Output: Lists all active resources for the specified service in the given region.
Steps to Build the Script
Setup
Editor: Use VS Code to write the script.
Environment: Use an AWS EC2 instance to run and test the script (preferred for Windows users).
Script Outline
Start with comments:

Purpose: "This script lists active AWS resources."
Author info (e.g., your name, team).
Versioning for tracking updates (e.g., v0.1).
Validations:

Check if required arguments (region and service) are provided.
Verify that AWS CLI is installed and configured.
Core Logic:

Use AWS CLI to interact with AWS services.
Validate supported services (e.g., EC2, S3, EBS) and reject invalid inputs.
Use switch-case for better performance over if-else.
Command Execution:

Example for EC2: aws ec2 describe-instances.
Example for S3: aws s3api list-buckets.
Security Best Practices:

Limit script permissions using chmod (e.g., chmod 711).
Steps to Run the Script
Install AWS CLI and configure it using aws configure.
Execute the script:
bash
Copy code
./aws_resource_list.sh <region> <service>
Example:
bash
Copy code
./aws_resource_list.sh us-east-1 ec2
Interview-Relevant Details
Why is this Project Important?
Cost optimization is critical in DevOps.
Automating resource monitoring reduces manual overhead.
How Does It Work?
Shell script reads user-provided inputs (region, service).
Validates inputs and communicates with AWS via AWS CLI.
Outputs the list of active resources.
Key Features
Validation for correct inputs and AWS CLI setup.
Efficient use of switch-case for conditional logic.
Incorporates security practices like permission restrictions.
Common Interview Questions
Why use AWS CLI instead of direct API calls?
To simplify implementation; AWS CLI handles authentication and API complexities.
What services does the script support?
EC2, S3, EBS, etc., based on organization requirements.
How do you secure the script?
By restricting permissions (e.g., chmod) and avoiding sensitive information in the script.
