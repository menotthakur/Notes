Verizon Cloud Platform Job Simulation on Forage - January 2025

 * Completed a job simulation involving building a hypothetical new VPN product
   for Verizon’s Cloud Computing team.
 * Used command line Python to test whether Verizon’s VPN met the cloud-native
   traits, i.e. redundancy, resiliency and least-privilege.
 * Researched approaches to achieve application security and communicated
   insights in a PowerPoint Presentation.

“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Verizon's Cloud Computing Job Simulation on the
Forage platform and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like
to participate in on a Cloud Computing Team at Verizon.
I worked on a project to complete a VPN testing stimulation. I contributed to a
presentation covering the three approaches to securing an application in the
cloud, and practiced using my python skills in a real-world context.
Through this program I realized that I really enjoy working on these types of
technical business problems and would love to apply what I've learned in a Cloud
Computing Team at a company like Verizon.
